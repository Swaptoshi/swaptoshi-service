== Build Docker image

.Inside the klayr-service root folder
----
make build-images
----
This creates the necessary Docker images to start Klayr Service in the containers.

== Start

.Inside the klayr-service root folder
----
cp ./docker/example.env .env
----
----
make up
----

This will start Klayr Service with the default configuration, which in turn will connect to a Klayr Core Mainnet node.

In case a different node or network shall be used, xref:{url_config}[configure] Klayr Service accordingly.

== Stop

.Inside the klayr-service root folder
----
make down
----

This will stop Klayr Service.

== Show the status of Docker containers

----
docker ps
----

== Reset the Klayr Service database

To reset the database of Klayr Service, drop the respective MySQL and Redis databases.

Before resetting the database, stop Klayr Service:

----
make stop
----

Now connect to the Docker container in which you wish to reset the database. If you are not sure what to choose here, check the available containers via <<show-the-status-of-docker-containers>>.

To connect to the interactive shell of the MySQL Docker container in which you wish to reset the MySQL database, execute the following command:

----
docker exec -it klayr-service-mysql-primary-1 bash
----

=== Drop Database

[tabs]
====
MySQL DB::
+
--
. Login to MySQL with the `klayr` user.
+
----
mysql -uklayr -ppassword
----
+
On successful login, you enter the MYSQL command-line client:
+
----
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 2044
Server version: 8.0.27 MySQL Community Server - GPL

----
. Drop the `klayr` database.
+
----
mysql> drop database klayr;
----
. Create a fresh database `klayr`.
+
----
mysql> create database klayr;
----
. Log out from MySQL by typing `quit;`
+
----
mysql> quit;
----

Log out of the docker container by pressing kbd:[CRTL] + kbd:[D].

--
MariaDB::
+
--
MariaDB also uses the same SQL commands for querying and manipulating the relevant data, including data storage, client libraries, and replication.

. Login to MariaDB with the `klayr` user.
+
----
docker exec -it klayr_mariadb mysql -uroot -p
----
+
On successful login, you enter the MariaDB command-line client:
+
----
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MariaDB connection id is 9
Server version: 10.7.8-MariaDB-1:10.7.8+maria~ubu2004 mariadb.org binary distribution

. Drop the `klayr` database.
+
----
MariaDB [(none)]> drop database klayr;
----
+
.Result
----
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.009 sec)
----
. Create a fresh database `klayr`
+
----
MariaDB [(none)]> create database klayr;
----
+
.Result
----
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.001 sec)
----
. Log out by typing `quit;`.
+
----
MariaDB [(none)]> exit;
----

Log out of the docker container by pressing kbd:[CRTL] + kbd:[D].
--
====

=== Flush Redis DB

Reset the databases for Redis after dropping the MySQL database:

.Execute command in running docker container.
----
sudo docker exec -it klayr-service_redis_core_persistent_1 /bin/sh
----

.Truncate redis database.
----
redis-cli flushall
----

TIP: Log out of the docker container again by pressing kbd:[CRTL] + kbd:[D].

[NOTE]
====
The `flushall` command truncates all existing Redis databases:

> Deletes all the keys of all the existing databases, not just the current selected one. This command never fails.

For more information, check the Redis documentation: {url_FLUSHALL}[FLUSHALL].

To flush only a particular DB in Redis, execute the following command instead:

----
redis-cli -n <db_number> flushdb
----
====

=== Start Klayr Service

After the databases are reset, start Klayr Service again as usual:

----
make up
----

NOTE: When Klayr Service is started again after a database reset, then the process to reindex all the data is initiated.
This can be quite time-consuming when the chain is long, spanning over hours.

== Taking Snapshots

If you wish to take a snapshot of your Docker installation, the details can be found here on the xref:{url_backups}[Snapshots] page.

== Logging

The possibility exists here to either use the `docker` commands or the `make` commands to check the logs, and both options are listed here below.

For `docker`, to check the logs for the different microservices of Klayr Service, use the command `docker container logs CONTAINER`, where `CONTAINER` is the respective Docker container that holds the logs you wish to view.

For example, to see the logs for the Gateway microservice, execute the following command:

----
docker container logs klayr-service_gateway_1
----

To check the logs for different microservices using the `make` commands, the following commands listed below can be used:

.Displays the logs for all the microservices that have been logged so far, and that are currently existing
----
make logs
----

.Displays the latest logs for all the microservices
----
make logs-live
----

.Displays the logs for the specified microservice.
----
make logs-blockchain-connector
----
In the above example, it will display logs only for the `blockchain-connector` microservice.

.Displays the latest logs for the specified microservice.
----
make logs-live-blockchain-connector
----
In the above example, it will display the latest logs only for the `blockchain-connector` microservice.


Replace the `blockchain-connector` with the specific service name required.


== Upgrade Klayr Service
